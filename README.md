# MisterMiros's Todos Project

Hey, my name is Miroslav and this is a small project I made to practice my software engineering and AWS skills.

This repository contains shared AWS resources for a plethora of projects. The resources are defined with [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) and are deployed with the help of [AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html#what-is-sam-cli).
